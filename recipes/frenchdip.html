        <h2>Juicy, Delicious, and Easy French Dip</h2>
        <p>These easy French Dip Sandwiches are perfect for weeknight dinners or this Sunday’s Super Bowl game! French rolls are stuffed with thinly sliced roast beef, topped with sautéed onions and provolone cheese. The quick au jus is the perfect thing to dunk these sandwiches in.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>1 Shallot, Chopped</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Flour</li>
            <li>1 Jigger Dry Sherry</li>
            <li>2 Cans Beef Broth</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Lb Roast Beef</li>
            <li>Coarse Ground Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>4 Outdoor Sandwich Rolls</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large, shallow skillet over moderate heat, melt butter. Add shallots to butter and saute 2 minutes. Add flour to butter and shallot and cook a minute longer. Whisk in sherry and cook liquid out. Whisk in consomme in a slow stream. Bring sauce to a bubble and allow to simmer over low heat until ready to serve sandwiches.</li>
                <li>Pile meat loosely across your cutting board or a large work surface. Season meat with grill seasoning or salt and black pepper. Set out 4 ramekins or small soup cups for dipping sauce, 4 dinner plates and 4 split torpedo rolls. To assemble, using a pair of kitchen tongs, dip meat into loose au jus sauce and pile into rolls. Set ramekins or cups with extra dipping sauce along side the sandwiches.</li>
